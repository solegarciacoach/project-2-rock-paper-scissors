# Let's play 'Rock, Paper & Scissors'!

The **'Rock, Paper & Scissors'** website is a modern, interactive take on the classic hand game. 

Users of this website will be able to challenge the computer in a battle of wits and reflexes. Users will be able to choose their weapon (rock, paper, or scissors) ans see if they can outsmart the AI opponent.

The website offers a fun and relaxing way to take a break while potentially imrpoving users decision-making skills.
